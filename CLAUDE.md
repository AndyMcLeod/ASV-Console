# ASV Simulator — project guide (CLAUDE.md)

Browser-only command-and-control (C2) shore station **and simulator** for a
small-class **survey ASV** (autonomous surface vehicle, ~2 m × 0.75 m, battery,
short surveys in constrained water). Single-file stdlib-Python server
(`asv_console.py`) + one vanilla-JS page (`static/asv.html`), plus a read-only
`static/playback.html` session-review page. No pip, no build step, Python 3
standard library only.

This project is a **sanitized, generic derivative** — it carries no vendor,
model, or proprietary-protocol identity. Keep it that way: do **not** reintroduce
brand names, model numbers, vendor manual citations, or a specific wire-protocol
format. The onboard controller is the generic **VCU (Vehicle Control Unit)**; the
shore link is a generic serial-over-IP control link.

## Run it

```bash
python asv_console.py --sim --browser none --port 8791          # headless, for testing
python asv_console.py --sim                                     # opens a browser tab
python asv_console.py --sim --vessel example_usv_4m             # study a different ASV
```

- Web UI at `http://localhost:<port>/`; playback at `/playback`.
- Commands: `POST /api/cmd/{arm,upload,start,pause,stop,estop,rth,goto,hold,sethome,transit}`.
- Vessels: `GET /api/vessel` (active + params + available list), `GET /api/vessels` (list), `POST /api/vessel {id}` (switch — only when disarmed & idle).
- State + telemetry stream over SSE at `/events`; snapshot at `/api/state` (live telemetry is nested under `status`).
- Session recorder writes `logs/*.jsonl` (disable with `--no-log`); playback reads them via `/api/logs`, `/api/log?file=`.
- `--acm <host>` (generic VCU host) + `--transport {tcp,serial}` for a real link; `RealVcu` opens the transport but **refuses to actuate** (no wire format implemented — honest 409, never a fabricated frame).

## Architecture

- **`VcuLink` seam** with two implementations: `SimVcu` (full boat model — GPS
  fix, waypoint-following autonomy, battery drain, wind/wave environmental
  effects) and `RealVcu` (transport + honest protocol stubs).
- **`Engine`** owns authoritative C2 state (armed / e-stop / run / plan) and the
  arming gates. The console comes up SAFE and read-only; every actuating command
  requires an explicit ARM.
- **Safety model:** the RC transmitter is master; this console is additive and
  cannot touch the RC autonomy switch or E-stop. Link-loss is safe (stop
  commanding, surface the vehicle failsafe: motors 0 / steering straight; never
  auto-resume). Commands are validated/clamped before encode.

## Vessel configuration (the single source of truth for a modeled ASV)

Every vessel-specific parameter lives in one self-contained `vessels/<id>.json`
file — hull/windage, speeds, turn rate, guidance gains, battery banding + drain,
planning defaults, and spawn. The console studies ASV behavior **across vessel
types**: `--vessel <id>` picks the active profile at startup, and the UI's vessel
picker (or `POST /api/vessel`) switches live when disarmed & idle (the sim
respawns with the new physics).

- **Server:** `load_vessel()` reads + `validate_vessel()` checks a profile at
  load (missing/mistyped field → clear, path-pointed error; a bad file never runs
  with placeholder physics). `apply_vessel()` publishes the values to the module
  globals `SimVcu` reads (`SPEED_KN`, `MAX_TURN_RATE_DEG_S`, `BATT_*`, `WP_*`,
  `WIND_*`, `DRAIN_*`, `SPAWN_*`, etc.). **Do not reintroduce hardcoded vessel
  constants** — add/adjust the vessel file instead.
- **Client:** `loadVessel()` fetches `/api/vessel` and drives the JS mirrors
  (`SPEED_KN`, `MAX_TURN_RATE_DEG_S`, `NOGO_BUFFER_M`, search-pattern sizes), so
  the server and UI never disagree.
- **Adding a vessel:** drop a new `vessels/<id>.json` (copy an existing one; it
  must be complete — validation requires every field). `vessels/zboat_1800hs.json`
  models the small survey ASV; `vessels/drix08.json` models the Exail DriX H-8 (7.71 m diesel USV; see
  its `notes` for official-spec vs doc-derived vs estimated figures); `vessels/example_usv_4m.json`
  is a larger illustrative USV for comparison. A profile may name a real modeled
  vessel (it's data); keep the console *core* generic (no vendor protocol / manual figures).

## Behaviors (all ENC-aware, arm-gated)

Go-To, Return-to-Home, Hold/station-keep, Set-Home, Transit (multi-vertex),
Search patterns (expanding box / sector / parallel), and Survey (CAMP-style
boustrophedon with Punch-Out clipping to NOAA ENC features + arbitrary polygon
clip). Every commanded motion routes clear of a startup-built **nogo model**
(shoreline + manmade features + water shallower than a 1 m corrected floor),
with COLREGS Rule-9 keep-right in channels. Real-time water-level datum
correction from NOAA CO-OPS; wind/wave sim from NOAA NDBC buoys.

Public data sources (kept): NOAA ENC / ENCDirect ArcGIS, NOAA CO-OPS water
levels, NOAA NDBC buoys, NOAA chart tiles. All cached under `charts/`
(gitignored, regenerated at runtime).

## Testing notes

- Headless: `python asv_console.py --sim --browser none --port 8791`, then drive
  via the `/api/cmd/*` endpoints and read `/api/state` / `/events`.
- The map page canvas animates continuously — **browser-pane screenshots time
  out**; verify via DOM/`read_page` or the state endpoints instead.
- Windows/store-Python gotcha: a stray server process can hold the port and serve
  stale code. Check `netstat -ano | grep :<port>` and `taskkill //F //PID <n>`
  before retesting server changes.

## Keep docs current

When a change alters **user-facing** behavior, update the relevant README(s) in
the same change — `README.md` (overview + "Using it"), `README_SIM.md` (sim model
/ command flow / endpoints / walkthrough), `README_PLAYBACK.md`. Don't let them
drift behind the code.

## Not yet done

Not a git repo yet. `RealVcu` command/telemetry codecs are unimplemented by
design (this is a simulator). Design docs: `PLAN.md`, `ASV_BEHAVIORS_PLAN.md`,
`ENC_PUNCHOUT_PLAN.md`.
