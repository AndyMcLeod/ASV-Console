# ASV Simulator — project guide (CLAUDE.md)

Browser-only command-and-control (C2) shore station **and simulator** for a
small-class **survey ASV** (autonomous surface vehicle, ~2 m × 0.75 m, battery,
short surveys in constrained water). Single-file stdlib-Python server
(`asv_console.py`) + one vanilla-JS page (`static/asv.html`), plus a read-only
`static/playback.html` session-review page. No pip, no build step, Python 3
standard library only.

This project is a **sanitized, generic derivative** — it carries no vendor,
model, or proprietary-protocol identity. Keep it that way: do **not** reintroduce
brand names, model numbers, vendor manual citations, or a specific wire-protocol
format. The onboard controller is the generic **VCU (Vehicle Control Unit)**; the
shore link is a generic serial-over-IP control link.

## Run it

```bash
python asv_console.py --sim --browser none --port 8791          # headless, for testing
python asv_console.py --sim                                     # opens a browser tab
python asv_console.py --sim --vessel example_usv_4m             # study a different ASV
```

- Web UI at `http://localhost:<port>/`; playback at `/playback`.
- Commands: `POST /api/cmd/{arm,upload,start,pause,stop,estop,rth,goto,hold,sethome,transit}`.
- Vessels: `GET /api/vessel` (active + params + available list), `GET /api/vessels` (list), `POST /api/vessel {id}` (switch — only when disarmed & idle).
- State + telemetry stream over SSE at `/events`; snapshot at `/api/state` (live telemetry is nested under `status`).
- Session recorder writes `logs/*.jsonl` (disable with `--no-log`); playback reads them via `/api/logs`, `/api/log?file=`.
- `--acm <host>` (generic VCU host) + `--transport {tcp,serial}` for a real link; `RealVcu` opens the transport but **refuses to actuate** (no wire format implemented — honest 409, never a fabricated frame).

## Architecture

- **`VcuLink` seam** with two implementations: `SimVcu` (full boat model — GPS
  fix, waypoint-following autonomy, battery drain, wind/wave environmental
  effects) and `RealVcu` (transport + honest protocol stubs).
- **`Engine`** owns authoritative C2 state (armed / e-stop / run / plan) and the
  arming gates. The console comes up SAFE and read-only; every actuating command
  requires an explicit ARM.
- **Safety model:** the RC transmitter is master; this console is additive and
  cannot touch the RC autonomy switch or E-stop. Link-loss is safe (stop
  commanding, surface the vehicle failsafe: motors 0 / steering straight; never
  auto-resume). Commands are validated/clamped before encode.

## Vessel configuration (the single source of truth for a modeled ASV)

Every vessel-specific parameter lives in one self-contained `vessels/<id>.json`
file — hull/windage, speeds, turn rate, guidance gains, an **energy model**,
planning defaults (incl. under-keel clearance), and spawn. The console studies ASV
behavior **across vessel types**: `--vessel <id>` picks the active profile at
startup, and the UI's vessel picker (or `POST /api/vessel`) switches live when
disarmed & idle (the sim respawns with the new physics).

**Energy model** — `power.type` is `"battery"` (voltage that sags with load; block
`battery_v` + `drain`) or `"fuel"` (diesel litres burned at ~`idle + (full-idle)·
(v/vmax)^exp`; block `fuel`). Battery vessels report V/%, fuel vessels report
fuel %/endurance/range. Validation branches on the type. The DriX is `fuel`.

**Vessel-aware nogo** — the nogo depth floor is `hull.draft_m +
planning.under_keel_clearance_m` (a deep-draft boat avoids more shallow water). The
client reads it via `/api/vessel` and **re-extracts** the nogo model on a switch.

**COLREGS Rule 9 keep-right** — transits offset to the starboard side of a channel
(a lane 20% right of center). It engages only where both channel walls are within a
detection reach; that reach is `planning.channel_reach_m` (optional; falls back to
`nogo_buffer_m*10`, the tight-marina scale). The DriX sets 120 m so it keeps right
in the wide (~150 m) Lewes dredged fairway; small boats in tight marinas keep the
default. **Lateral channel marks** (ENC `chan_mark` role = lateral buoys + beacons, with
`CATLAM`) drive channel behavior: a mark abeam on a side is a keep-right wall there,
and `pairGates()`/`gateProject()` pair a port-hand + starboard-hand mark into a
**gate** and, where a Go-To/RTH exits through the outermost gate, steer the route
**through the gate centre** and **stand on one gate-width past it** along the channel
axis before turning — so the fairway projects past the seaward buoys instead of
cutting the mouth. No-op with no gates / target not past the gate / any unclear leg.
Marks are also small keep-outs (don't hit a buoy) and drawn green (port-hand) / red
(starboard-hand).

- **Server:** `load_vessel()` reads + `validate_vessel()` checks a profile at
  load (missing/mistyped field → clear, path-pointed error; a bad file never runs
  with placeholder physics). `apply_vessel()` publishes the values to the module
  globals `SimVcu` reads (`SPEED_KN`, `MAX_TURN_RATE_DEG_S`, `BATT_*`/`DRAIN_*` or
  `FUEL_*`, `POWER_TYPE`, `MIN_NAV_DEPTH_M`, `WP_*`, `WIND_*`, `SPAWN_*`, etc.).
  **Do not reintroduce hardcoded vessel constants** — add/adjust the vessel file.
- **Client:** `loadVessel()` fetches `/api/vessel` and drives the JS mirrors
  (`SPEED_KN`, `MAX_TURN_RATE_DEG_S`, `NOGO_BUFFER_M`, `NOGO_MIN_DEPTH_M`,
  search-pattern sizes) and the energy gauge (BATT vs FUEL), so server and UI agree.
- **Adding a vessel:** drop a new `vessels/<id>.json` (copy an existing one; it
  must be complete — validation requires every field). `vessels/zboat_1800hs.json`
  models the small survey ASV; `vessels/drix08.json` models the Exail DriX H-8 (7.71 m diesel USV; see
  its `notes` for official-spec vs doc-derived vs estimated figures); `vessels/example_usv_4m.json`
  is a larger illustrative USV for comparison. A profile may name a real modeled
  vessel (it's data); keep the console *core* generic (no vendor protocol / manual figures).

## Behaviors (all ENC-aware, arm-gated)

Go-To, Return-to-Home, Hold/station-keep, Set-Home, Transit (multi-vertex),
Search patterns (expanding box / sector / parallel), and Survey (CAMP-style
boustrophedon with Punch-Out clipping to NOAA ENC features + arbitrary polygon
clip). Punch-Out also **excludes a navigation channel when the survey spans across
it** (`channelSpanKeepouts`): a coverage line that runs outside→into the channel
→outside gets a gap there. The channel is the ENC **dredged area** OR the
**buoy-gate fairway** — `pairGates()` pairs the lateral marks and sweeps each gate
line ±one gate-width into a corridor polygon (so a marked inlet with no dredged
polygon is covered too). It applies ONLY to the survey-line clip, not to the transit
routing — so normal transits still cross the channel, and a survey confined *within*
a channel (never out→in→out) is unaffected. Every commanded motion routes
clear of a startup-built **nogo model**
(shoreline + manmade features + water shallower than a 1 m corrected floor),
with COLREGS Rule-9 keep-right in channels. Real-time water-level datum
correction from NOAA CO-OPS; wind/wave sim from NOAA NDBC buoys.

**Survey operational awareness & editing:** (1) hovering the survey line the ASV is
currently on (running survey) shows a time-to-end-of-line tooltip (remaining dist /
live SOG); (2) WPT mode edits a punched plan before Upload — drag a waypoint (its
line endpoint follows), click a waypoint to delete, click a line to delete it (+ its
endpoints), click open water to add; (3) the **LINES** panel shows a per-line table
(length, planned time = length/speed, and ACTUAL time accrued while running — keyed
off the boat's active line, robust to Upload re-routing), written to the session log
as a `client:survey_lines` event on run end (`POST /api/logevent`).

Public data sources (kept): NOAA ENC / ENCDirect ArcGIS, NOAA CO-OPS water
levels, NOAA NDBC buoys, NOAA chart tiles. All cached under `charts/`
(gitignored, regenerated at runtime).

## Testing notes

- Headless: `python asv_console.py --sim --browser none --port 8791`, then drive
  via the `/api/cmd/*` endpoints and read `/api/state` / `/events`.
- The map page canvas animates continuously — **browser-pane screenshots time
  out**; verify via DOM/`read_page` or the state endpoints instead.
- Windows/store-Python gotcha: a stray server process can hold the port and serve
  stale code. Check `netstat -ano | grep :<port>` and `taskkill //F //PID <n>`
  before retesting server changes.

## Keep docs current

When a change alters **user-facing** behavior, update the relevant README(s) in
the same change — `README.md` (overview + "Using it"), `README_SIM.md` (sim model
/ command flow / endpoints / walkthrough), `README_PLAYBACK.md`. Don't let them
drift behind the code.

## Not yet done

Git repo (local, no GitHub remote). `RealVcu` command/telemetry codecs are
unimplemented by design (this is a simulator). Design docs: `PLAN.md`,
`ASV_BEHAVIORS_PLAN.md`, `ENC_PUNCHOUT_PLAN.md`.

## SESSION CHECKPOINT — 2026-07-23 ("ASV Simulator Project Continued 1" handoff)

Full context for resuming in a fresh session. Everything below is committed
(clean working tree). `git log --oneline` is the authoritative record.

### How this project started
Derived from `D:\Claude\Zboat` (the Teledyne Z-Boat console) as a **sanitized,
brand-free generic ASV simulator**. All vendor/model/proprietary identity was
stripped (VCU not ACM; no ZBoat/Teledyne names, no proprietary wire protocol).
Then a **per-vessel config system** was added (`vessels/*.json`, single source of
truth loaded by server + served to client). Do NOT reintroduce brand identity into
the console core; vessel *files* may name real modeled vessels.

### Current state
- **Server running** (during dev) on port **8781**, active vessel **drix08**,
  logging ON (`logs/asv_*.jsonl`). Restart pattern: kill stale PIDs on the port
  first (see Testing notes), then `python asv_console.py --sim --vessel drix08`.
- **Vessels:** `zboat_1800hs` (small battery ASV), `example_usv_4m` (battery),
  `drix08` = **Exail DriX H-8**, 7.71 m **diesel** (fuel model), operating from the
  **UDel Lewes facility** — spawn `38.789650, -75.160940` (Lewes-Rehoboth Canal
  centerline). DriX tuned params: `nogo_buffer_m 5`, `under_keel_clearance_m 0.3`
  (nogo floor 2.3 m), `channel_reach_m 120` (Rule 9 fairway reach for the wide
  Lewes channel), speeds 4/7/14 kn, `max_turn_rate_deg_s 20`.

### What was built this session (newest first — see commit hashes)
1. **Survey ops-awareness/editing:** hover current line → time-to-end tooltip;
   WPT-mode plan editing (drag waypoint / click-delete waypoint / **Shift**-click
   line to delete / plain click adds); **LINES** panel per-line table (length,
   plan, actual) logged as `client:survey_lines` via `POST /api/logevent`.
   Mission duration on Punch Out split into **Survey** + **Approach** vessel-card
   rows; TIME pill shows **local · UTC** (1 s ticker).
2. **Punch-Out channel exclusion:** a survey that SPANS ACROSS a channel excludes
   it from coverage (`channelSpanKeepouts`, survey-clip only — transits unaffected,
   internal-channel surveys unaffected). Channel = dredged area OR **buoy-gate
   fairway** (`pairGates` sweeps a corridor).
3. **Lateral channel marks (buoys/beacons):** server role `chan_mark` + `CATLAM`
   (cache bumped to `features_v3_`); client draws them (green port / red stbd),
   keeps clear, uses them as Rule 9 channel walls; `gateProject()` steers a
   Go-To/RTH through the outer gate centre and stands on past it.
4. **Rule 9 keep-right** vessel-tunable reach (`channel_reach_m`); DriX now keeps
   right in the ~150 m Lewes fairway (was tuned for tight marinas).
5. **DriX fixes:** couldn't route around ENC objects → buffer 10→5 m; UKC 0.5→0.3;
   spawn moved to Lewes (from Presque Isle).
6. **Trail:** persists across page refresh within a session, **dropped on sim
   reboot** (tagged with server `boot_id`).
7. **Named-reason nogo refusal highlight** for Go-To/RTH AND Survey/Transit/Punch
   Out legs (pulses the offending feature + ✕ marker; names the kind).
8. **Server:** suppress benign client-disconnect tracebacks; `boot_id` +
   `/api/logevent` + `/api/vessel(s)` endpoints; energy model (battery|fuel).

### NEEDS LIVE VERIFICATION (couldn't drive in the sandbox — localhost is blocked
in the in-app browser, and canvas screenshots time out). All were unit/harness-
tested where possible, but the click/drag/hover UX itself is unverified in a real
browser:
- WPT-mode waypoint **drag** feel + hit radius (10 px); **Shift**-click line delete.
- **Hover** time-to-end tooltip on the active line during a run.
- **LINES** panel live actuals + the auto-log on run end.
- Gate-pairing projection visually threading the Roosevelt Inlet jetty gate.

### Open threads / possible next
- Only ONE gate is charted in the Lewes ENC cell (Roosevelt Inlet jetty lights +
  Buoy 4); gate features engage only where marks exist.
- Mission-duration estimate is straight length ÷ speed (no turn/accel modeling).
- Could add a playback-viewer table view of the logged `survey_lines` events.

### Key gotchas learned (don't relearn these)
- **Client-side routing:** `routeAround`/`keepRight`/`planNogoRoute`/`gateProject`
  are ALL browser JS. Driving via raw `/api/cmd/*` + `upload` with no `route`
  BYPASSES ENC routing → the boat crosses nogo. The GUI Punch-Out+Upload flow
  routes clear.
- **Stale server PIDs** on Windows hold the port and serve old code — always kill
  by PID before retesting server changes.
- **Testing pattern that works well:** extract the real JS functions from
  `static/asv.html` with a brace-balance grabber into a Node harness and run
  against real ENC fetched from `/api/enc` (see the many scratchpad `*.js` tests).
- Delete a stale `mission.json` to pick up new vessel defaults (it persists old
  buffer/arrival).
